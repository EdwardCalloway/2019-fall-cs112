#PA1 Reflection
I really struggled with this assignment, I was unclear with what we were supposed to do and should have asked for help but instead I waited until the last minute thinking that this would be an easy assignment. My main struggle came from not properly understanding github and the merging of files within it. What I am taking away from this assignment is to instead of waiting on for the last minute begin early and then have people that I can talk to and ask for help so I can improve more later. I do now have a better grasp on github which will help with later assignments.
